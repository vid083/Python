Case 1
Input: 4567
Expected Output: 2
Explanation : Odd positions are 4 and 6 as they are pos: 1 and pos: 3, both have sum 10. 
Similarly, 5 and 7 are at even positions pos: 2 and pos: 4 with sum 12. 
Thus, difference is 12 â€“ 10 = 2

Case 2
Input: 5476
Expected Output: 2

code steps:
1. sum of odd, even positions
2. greater sum - less
3.
